          <p>
            Notions comes with only limited set of icons. We can get beautiful icons from many websites like
            <a href="https://icons8.com/" target="_blank"> Icon8 </a> ,
            <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" target="_blank"> Flaticon </a> ,
            But it is painful to add icons from those websites to notion notes. Because you need to first the right icon from 1000 of icons,
            customize and download to your computer. Then you upload new icon to Notion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Notion icons you can easily add colorful icons to your notes.
