              Why did I build Notion Icons?
            </h1>
            <p>
              I switched to Notion for note taking and have been loving it. I use the popular
              <a href="https://youtu.be/FZIMlWLW4gU" target="_blank"> PARA </a> ( Projects, Areas, Resources, Archieve )
              method to save resources I learn from all sources like blogs, videos , podcasts, books etc.
              I like using colorful Icons in notes as it gives a quick visual context. Here is example from my Notion.
            </p>
            <figure class="image box">
              <img class="card" width="70%" src="~assets/notions-related-icons.png" alt="Raja Notion Screen shot">
            </figure>
            <p>
              Notions comes with only limited set of icons. We can get beautiful icons from many websites like
              <a href="https://icons8.com/" target="_blank"> Icon8 </a> ,
              <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" target="_blank"> Flaticon </a> .
              But it is painful to add icons from those websites to notion notes.  I need to first find the right icon from thousands of icons,
              then customize and download to my computer. After that I can upload new icon to Notion.
            </p>
            <p>
              I searched for better solution and found easy to use Icons from <a href="https://www.notion.vip/icons/" target="_blank"> notion.vip </a>,
              but again it doesn't have all the Icons I want to use. But I like it's idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also saw from reddit posts that other people are also looking for solution to this problem. So I decided to build this tool Myself
              and share it with the Notion community.
